In this project, I proposed, deployed, conducted experiment for a smart visual search system. The system can recognize a landmark in a picture taken by a mobile camera and provides adaptive augmented information extracted automatically from Wikipedia and other online sources. The proposed method and system can be easily customized into different augmented reality systems for books, posters, or any visual objects...\r\n\r\n[![ScreenShot](http://res.cloudinary.com/dppqpdago/image/upload/v1443517365/Screen_Shot_2015-09-29_at_11.02.19_AM_lyc5gg.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8U6eEx7tQo&list=PLWlCg_90R7rup8GANzT6Ie_pAyogSdfVW)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
